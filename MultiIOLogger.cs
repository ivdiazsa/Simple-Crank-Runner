// Class: MultiIOLogger
// This class used as a printer instead of the usual 'Console' class. This one
// is made to print to the console and record to a log at the same time. Note
// that it expects its input including whatever newlines you might want to add.
// In other words, it calls implicitly Write(), not WriteLine(). This, to give
// the user the most control over the output, and to keep all printing source
// code uniform throughout the app.
